     the night.   she brushed her hands upon my flushed cheek   smelled of childhood remnants of a dusty weeping willow   clouds soothe, shredded by the calico   were oh so vast and quick as i was on my own now.    this time like every other time i believe that i never find   another sweet little girl with secret sea foam eyes   ocean lapping voice smile coy as the brightest quiet span of sky   and i'm all alone again tonight not again, not again, not again.             and don't it feel alright, and don't it feel so nice   lovely. lovely, lovely   say it again, say it again.    still i'm unable to inhale all the riches   as i'm awkward as a wound on my bones   still i've got cobblestone joints and plate glass points   as i'm all by myself tonight not again not again    and don't it feel alright., and don't it feel so nice   lovely. lovely, lovely   say it again, say it again.    and if you should nervously break down   when its time for the shakedown would you take it   it's when you cry just a little   but you laugh in the middle that you've made it        and don't it feel alright, and don't it feel so nice.   lovely.   say it again. lovely. so lovely. to do it again   again. loving again. it's coming again.   lovely...
