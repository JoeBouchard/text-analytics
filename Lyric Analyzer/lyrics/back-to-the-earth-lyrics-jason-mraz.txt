     whenever my head starts to hurt   before it goes from bad to feeling worst   i turn off my phone   i get down low   i put my hands in the dirt   i try to stop the world from moving so fast   try and get a grip on where i'm at   to simplify this daisy life    and get my feet in the grass   i'm going back to the earth   i'm going back to the earth   i'm going back to work        i'm going back to the earth   yes i'm going back...   the only explanation for our rise   must be that everybody wants to get it high   move on up to a deluxe   appartement in the sky   the higher we go, the taller we grow old   we lose sight of our land below    you can have your place up in outer space   cause my home is where my food is grown   i'm going back to the earth   i'm going back to the earth   i'm going back to work   i'm going back to the earth   i'm going back to the earth   i'm going back to the earth        i'm going back to work   i'm going back to the earth   we are animals (we are animals)   we are wild (we are wild)   and we'll start with emotions at the bottom of the ocean   i was feeling from the top of the trees   we are animals (we are animals)   we are wild (we are wild)   and we'll truly be forgiven when we start getting back to living   with the land in harmony   i'm going back to the earth   i'm going back to the earth    oh yeah...   i listen to the whistle in the wind   it's blending with the songs of the birds   the messages remind me who i am   that i'm a child of the earth   it's where i find spirituality   it's in everything that surrounds me   you can spell god g-o-d   or you can spell it n-a-t-u-r-e    i'm going back to the earth    i'm going back to the earth   i'm going back to work   i'm going back to the earth   i'm going back!   i'm going back to the earth   i'm going back to the earth   i'm going back to work   i'm going back to the earth   i'm going back!
