     i still remember the look on your face   lit through the darkness at 1: 58   words that you whispered for just us to know   you told me you love me so why did you go away?   away...    i do recall now the smell of the rain   fresh on the pavement, i ran off the plane   that july 9th, the beat of your heart   it jumps through your shirt, i can still feel your arms    now i'll go sit on the floor wearing your clothes   all that i know is i don't know how to be something you miss   never thought we'd have a last kiss   never imagined we'd end like this   your name, forever the name on my lips        i do remember the swing in your step   the life of the party, you're showing off again   and i roll my eyes & then you pull me in   i'm not much for dancin' but for you i did    because i love your handshake, meetin' my father   i love how you walk with your hands in your pockets   how you'd kiss me when i was in the middle of sayin' something   there's not a day i don't miss those rude interruptions    and i'll go sit on the floor wearing your clothes   all that i know is i don't know how to be something you miss   never thought we'd have a last kiss   never imagined we'd end like this   your name, forever the name on my lips    so i watch your life in pictures like i used to watch you sleep   and i feel you forget me like i used to feel you breathe   and i keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are   hope it's nice where you are        and i hope the sun shines & it's a beautiful day   and something reminds you, you wish you had stayed   you can plan for a change in the weather & time   but i never planned on you changing your mind    so, i'll go sit on the floor wearing your clothes   all that i know is i don't know how to be something you miss   never thought we'd have a last kiss   never imagined we'd end like this   your name, forever the name on my lips    just like our last kiss   forever the name on my lips   just like our last   '
