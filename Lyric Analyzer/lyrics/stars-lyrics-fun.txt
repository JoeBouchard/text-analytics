     this growing old is getting old   i often find myself here thinking   about the birds, the boats, and past loves   that flew away or started sinking   and it's crazy here without you   i used to think this all was ours   we stay up late debate   on how we find our way   you say, "it's all up in the stars"    well, some nights i rule the world   with bar lights and pretty girls   but most nights i stay straight   and think about my mom, oh god   i miss her so much        and there are people on the street   they're coming up to me   and they're telling me   that they like what i do now   and so i tried my best when i took the fall   and get back right up and get in your arms   if you're out here why do i miss you so much?    i feel like i had it all   back before i lost it all   now i just wait for you to talk to me   but you won't even look at me, baby    and i've been saying that you   you're always holding onto stars   i think they're better from afar   cause no one (here) is going to save us        oh, and me   well i am fading in the dark   so don't you ever kiss me   don't you wish on me   why can't you see   that no one's going to save us?   come on, girl    come on girl   so should i or did i   i can't believe you'd do those things   i just need a helping hand   i close my eyes and think about tomorrow   it never came true   it came true   it never came true    and you, you're always holding onto stars   you're always holding onto stars   cause no one (here) is going to save us    oh and you, you're always holding onto stars   i think they're better from afar   cause no one (here) is going to save us   oh and me, well i am fading in the dark   so don't you ever kiss me   don't you wish on me   why can't you see that   no one is going to save us.   no one is going to save me.    no, no, no.   you're always holding onto stars   you're always holding onto stars   you're always holding onto stars   you're always holding onto stars   you're always holding onto stars   you're always holding onto stars   you're always holding onto stars   '
