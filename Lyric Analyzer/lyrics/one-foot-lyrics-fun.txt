     i'm standing in brooklyn just waiting for something to happen.   i can't help but love thinking that everyone doesn't get it.   to my left is a window   where did i go?   my reflection just blends in (to rows of clothes)   and bad ideas, but ideas nonetheless and so ...    i put one foot in front of the other one. (oh oh oh!)   i don't need a new love or a new life just a better place to die.   i put one foot in front of the other one. (oh oh oh!)   i don't need a new love or a new life just a better place to die.   i happen to stumble upon a chapel last night.   and i can't help but back up when i think of what happens inside.        i got friends looked in boxes. (that's no way to live)   what you're calling a sin isn't up to them   after all (after all), i thought we were all your children?   but i will die for my own sins - thanks a lot.   we'll rise up ourselves thanks for nothing at all   so up off the ground our forefathers are nothing but dust now.    i put one foot in front of the other one. (oh oh oh!)   i don't need a new love or a new life just a better place to die.    i put one foot in front of the other one. (oh oh oh!)   i don't need a new love or a new life just a better place to die.   maybe i should learn to shut my mouth.   i am over twenty-five and i can't make a name for myself    some nights i break down and cry   i'm lucky that my father's still alive, he's been fighting all his life   and if this is all i've ever know then may his soul live on forever in my song.   i put one foot in front of the other one. (oh oh oh!)        i don't need a new love or a new life just a better place to die.   i put one foot in front of the other one. (oh oh oh!)   i don't need a new love or a new life just a better place to die.   in front of the other one   in front of the other one   just a better place to die.   '
