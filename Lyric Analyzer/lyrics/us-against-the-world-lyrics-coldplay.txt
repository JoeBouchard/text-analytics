     oh morning   come bursting   the clouds amen   lift off this blindfold, let me see again    bring back the water that your ships roll in   in my heart she left a hole   the tightrope that i'm walking just sways and ties   the devil as he's talking with those angel's eyes    and i just want to be there when the lightning strikes   and the saints go marching in   and sing   slow-owowow-owowow-owowow-it down    through chaos as it swirls   it's us against the world   like a river to a raindrop   i lost a friend    my drunken hazard daniel in a lion's den   and tonight i know it all has to begin again   so whatever you do, don't let go   and if we could float away   fly up to the surface        and just start again   lift off before trouble   just erodes us in the rain   just erodes us in the rain   just erodes us, and see roses in the rain   sing   slow-owowow-owowow-owowow-it down   slow-owowow-owowow-owowow-it down   through chaos as it swirls   it's us against the world   through chaos as it swirls   it's us against the world.
