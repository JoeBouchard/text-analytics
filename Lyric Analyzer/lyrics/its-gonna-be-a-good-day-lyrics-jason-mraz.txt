     fall out of bed and catch a fading star   fancy i woke up before my alarm   rub my mind through my eyes   it's the best i can do   before it's automatic habit, over turning to you   though her smile when it happened, almost as if it was magic   it means there's a god somewhere and he's laughing   and i shuffle my slipperless toes to the kitchen   still low to the ground, but high on living    chorus   and i know, i know, it's gonna be a good day   hello, hello, you beautiful thing    waking up, i stretch my body and acknowledge some aches   it must be something i did yesterday   pour a cup of liquid gold, because my engine's still cold   but in a minute everything's gonna change        chorus   'cause i know, i know, it's gonna be a good day   hello, hello, you beautiful thing   hello, hello, you beautiful thing    this is what i've been waiting for (this is what i've been waiting for)   this is what i've been waiting for (this is what i've been waiting for)    [instrumental]    looking out from a cul-de-sac watching the bend of the earth take the black of the night from the dirt   i can see from the depths of my readjusting eyes a reflection of yes's in that ever changing sky   but why do bad dreams linger long after i awake?   i don't need no scenes of violence or pain replayed   and i feel quite foolish sometimes when i pray   but my thoughts are all i've got so i try to make them brave    and i know, i know, it's gonna be a good day   hello, hello, you beautiful thing   hello, hello, you beautiful thing   i say, hello, hello, you beautiful thing        oh now this is what i've been waiting for (this is what i've been waiting for)   oh this is what i've been waiting for (this is what i've been waiting for)   oh this is what i've been waiting for (this is what i've been waiting for)   oh this is what i've been waiting for (hello)    and i know, i know, it's gonna be a good day   hello, hello, you beautiful thing...
