     i'm dreaming of a white christmas   just like the ones i used to know (i used to know-ho-ho)   where the treetops glisten   and children listen   to hear sleigh bells in the snow (the snow).    i'm dreaming of a white christmas   with every christmas card i write   may your days be merry and bright   and all your christmases be white.             i'm dreaming of a white christmas   with every christmas card i write   may your dreams be merry and bright   and all your christmases be white.
