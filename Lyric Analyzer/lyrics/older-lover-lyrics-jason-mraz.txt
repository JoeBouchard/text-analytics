     well an old saying goes mind your manners,   mind your mother   and a man can find a lover   who is tan and undercover.   well she might lie about her age,   but lady i got no complaints.    well she can be as crazy and as foolish as she wants to be   because her old school ways are practical. technicalities are perfectly sane.   i'm saying i ain't never seen a saint.    i met her at an old cop bar down in silverlake,   where we joked about the give and we joked about the take.   and when they asked for identification   i knew her's probably was a fake.    she's just another older lover undercover.   she's just another old-school lover undercover.        she's wearing that thin disguise, don't apologize.   'cause your birthday suit suits you.   ooh, well it suits me too. it's one hell of a costume   i can't find the zipper anywhere on your back,   perhaps it's attached to the breach of your ass-crack.    (vocal improvisation)   burr, it's cold in here.   (vocal improvisation)   but you keep it hot, dear.    a sip of mexican coffee and grapefruit juice,   glass coke, glass of wine just to keep it loose.   oh the things that you say and do, yeah,   or the way that you groove to the music.   i like the who and the velvet underground old sounds   like indie rock, spock rock, anything you've found   in the backseat of your downtown brown, bruised beat up bmw.        i said you're down with the downtown.   down. i dig the old sounds.   down with the old lady, now.    you're just another older lover. and you're undercover.    are you wearing that thin disguise?   don't apologize.   your birthday suits you.   oh, well it suits me, too.   it's one hell of a costume.   i can't find the zipper anywhere on your back.   perhaps it's attached to the breach of your ass-crack.    (vocal improvisation)    any melodramatic role is just a garment of the soul.   i respect your nakedness and the way that you unfold   they say   the way your story's told.    you're just another older lover.   and you're undercover.
