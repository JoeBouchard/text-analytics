     the summer wind came blowin' in   from across the sea   it lingered there touched your hair   and walked with me    all summer long   we sang a song   then we strolled that golden sand   two sweethearts   and the summer wind    like painted kites, those days and nights   went flying by   the world was new   beneath a blue   umbrella sky        then softer than   a piper man   one day, it called to you   i lost you to   the summer wind    the autumn wind   and the winter wind   they have come and gone   but still those days   those lonely days   go on and on   but guess who sighs his lullabies   through nights that never end?   my fickle friend,   the summer wind        the autumn wind   and the winter wind   they have come and gone   but still those days   those lonely days   go on and on   but guess who sighs his lullabies   through nights that never end?   my fickle friend,   the summer wind    mmm... that summer wind.   warm warm summer wind   mmm... that summer wind.
