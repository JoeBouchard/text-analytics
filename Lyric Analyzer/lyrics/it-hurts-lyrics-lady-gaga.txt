     now for the second time in my destiny,   i find something so real, so pure, unicorn love within,   and i think you wanna keep the sparkle hiding   forever in your soul! haa-ho-o.    and i think, if only,   i could preserve me,   my soul so pure,so real, true beauty,   then i would have wasted all the stars in the sky to win this pride!    but now that i`ve found my haa-ho-o i`ll just scream loud and leak my tears, cuz!             everyday that i'm with you, i'll wear your favor-ite perfume. and on the days i am without, i'll wear only my tears, and pout. having you on me all night and day; makes me wanna hush and pray to never lose you..but it hurts; it hurts; oh, baby hear me out; it hurts it hurts.
