     i think, think when it's all over,   it just comes back in flashes, you know?   it's like a kaleidoscope of memories.   it just all comes back. but he never does.   i think part of me knew the second i saw him that this would happen.   it's not really anything he said or anything he did,   it was the feeling that came along with it.   and the crazy thing is i don't know if i'm ever gonna feel that way again.   but i don't know if i should.   i knew his world moved too fast and burned too bright.   but i just thought, how can the devil be pulling you toward someone who looks   so much like an angel when he smiles at you?   maybe he knew that when he saw me.   i guess i just lost my balance.   i think that the worst part of it all wasn't losing him.   it was losing me.        once upon a time a few mistakes ago   i was in your sights, you got me alone   you found me, you found me, you bound me   i guess you didn't care, and i guess i liked that   and when i fell hard you took a step back   without me, without me, without me    and he's long gone when he's next to me   and i realize the blame is on me    'cause i knew you were trouble when you walked in   so shame on me now   flew me to places i'd never been   'til you put me down, oh   i knew you were trouble when you walked in   so shame on me now   flew me to places i'd never been   now i'm lying on the cold hard ground   oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble   oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble        no apologies, he'll never see you cry   pretend he doesn't know that he's the reason why   you're drowning, you're drowning, you're drowning   now i heard you moved on from whispers on the street   a new notch in your belt is all i'll ever be   and now i see, now i see, now i see    he was long gone when he met me   and i realize the joke is on me, yeah!    i knew you were trouble when you walked in   so shame on me now   flew me to places i'd never been   'til you put me down, oh   i knew you were trouble when you walked in   so shame on me now   flew me to places i'd never been   now i'm lying on the cold hard ground   oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble   oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble    and the saddest fear comes creeping in   that you never loved me or her, or anyone, or anything, yeah    i knew you were trouble when you walked in   so shame on me now   flew me to places i'd never been   'til you put me down, oh   i knew you were trouble when you walked in   (you were right there, you were right there)   so shame on me now   flew me to places i'd never been   now i'm lying on the cold hard ground   oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble   oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble    i knew you were trouble when you walked in   trouble, trouble, trouble   i knew you were trouble when you walked in   trouble, trouble, trouble    i don't know if you know who you are until you lose who you are.
