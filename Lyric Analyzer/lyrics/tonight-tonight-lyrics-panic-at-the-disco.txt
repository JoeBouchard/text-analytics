     time is never time at all.   you can never ever leave without leaving a piece of youth.   and our lives are forever changed; we will never be the same.   the more you change the less you feel.    believe, believe in me, believe. (believe)   that life can change, that you're not stuck in vain.   we're not the same, we're different tonight.   tonight, tonight, so bright.   tonight, tonight.             and you know you're never sure, but you're sure you could be right;   if you held yourself up to the light.   and the embers never fade, in the city by the lake;   the place where you were born.    believe, believe in me, believe. (believe)   in the resolute urgency of now.   and if you believe there's not a chance tonight.   tonight, tonight, so bright.   tonight, tonight.             we'll crucify the insincere tonight. (tonight)   we'll make things right, we'll feel it all tonight. (tonight)   we'll find a way to offer up the night. (tonight)   the indescribable moments of your life. (tonight)   the impossible is possible tonight. (tonight)    believe in me as i believe in you, tonight.    tonight, tonight. [x2]   '
