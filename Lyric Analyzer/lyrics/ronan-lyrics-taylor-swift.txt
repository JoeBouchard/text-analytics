     i remember your bare feet,   down the hallway.   i remember your little laugh,   racecars on the kitchen floor,   plastic dinosaurs.   i love you to the moon and back.    i remember your blue eyes,   lookin' into mine,   like we had our own secret club.   i remember you dancin',   before bed time,   then jumpin' on me wakin' me up.   i can still feel you hold my hand,   little man.   and even the moment i knew,   you fought it hard like an army guy.   rememeber i,   leaned in and whispered to you:        come on baby with me,   we're gonna fly away, from here.   you were my best four years.    i remember the drive home,   when the blind hope turned   to cryin' and screamin' 'why'.   flowers pile up in the worst way,   no one knows what to say   about a beautiful boy who died.   and it's about to be halloween,   you could be anything you wanted,   if you were still here.   i remember the last day,   when i kissed your face   and whispered in your ear:        come on baby with me,   we're gonna fly away, from here.   out of this curtained room,   and this hospital gray.   we'll just disappear.    come on baby with me,   we're gonna fly away, from here.   you were my best four years.    and what if i'm standin' in your closet,   tryin' to talk to you.   and what if i kept the hand-me-downs   you won't grow into.   and what if i really thought,   some miracle would see us through.   and what if the miracle was even getting one moment with you.    come on baby with me,   we're gonna fly away, from here.    come on baby with me,   we're gonna fly away, from here.   you were my best four years.    i remember your bare feet,   down the hallway.   i love you to the moon and back   '
