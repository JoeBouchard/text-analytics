     and i'm, i'm over-joyed   and i'm, i'm over-loved   and i'm feeling lucky like a little boy   who's hiding under cover   and looking to discover   every way to play the part inside this darkened cave   the meaning of life, well it starts at the night light   close your eyes and i hope you see mine             and i've, well i've seen a thousand things in one place   but i stopped my counting when i saw your face   erasing memory, well i feel as though i've never seen a face before   until i saw your eyes   and they're smiling back at me through my tears   i've been counting all these years, oh   suddenly the thousand things i've seen were nothing more than dreams of   of you and me   you and me   quietly at a standstill now   fortunately you will, well you'll kiss me, i will   i will kiss you back        oh the fact of the matter is   and i don't know what the latter is, oh no way   see, i've always wanted to kiss you   but i, i always wanted to run from you   because i've always wanted to miss you   and i, i always wanted to comfort you    well i love my comfort foods, you said   while you always say, how do you do?
