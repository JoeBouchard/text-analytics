     every single hour in my hands,   and every second word that goes to send,   another day is tied behind my back,   another beating heart is all i have.    not this time, around,   not thid time around,   if you came around,   i'd leave the skies today,   not this time around.    i never thought i'd live to see this day,   i always knew the sun would burn away,   never had the strength to turn away,   in the end is always is always how i feel,    not this time around,   not this time around,        not this time around,   not thid time around,   if you came around,   i'd leave the skies today,   not this time around.    how will i   will you find me?   how will i been away?   oh will i   will you find me?   how will i ever know?    i dont believe in beautiful mistakes,   every turn of fate is on the take,   another turn or second chance goes by,   every wrong turn comes an eye to eye.    not this time around,   not this time around,        not this time around,   not thid time around,   if you came around,   i'd leave the skies today,   not this time around.    not this time around,   i'd leave the skies today,   not this time around,   not this time around    not this time around,   not this time around,   i'd leave the skies today.
