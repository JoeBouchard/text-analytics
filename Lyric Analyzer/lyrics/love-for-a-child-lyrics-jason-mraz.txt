     there's a picture on my kitchen wall   looks like jesus and his friends involved   there's a party getting started in the yard   and there's a couple getting steamy in the car, parked in the drive   was i too young to see this with my eyes?    and by the pool that night, apparently   the chemicals weren't mixed properly   you hit your head and then forgot your name   then you woke up at the bottom by the drain   and now your altitude and memory's a shame    what about taking this empty cup and filling it up   with a little bit more of innocence, i haven't had enough   it's probably because when you're young   it's okay to be easily ignored   i'd like to believe it was all about love for a child        when the house was left in shambles   who was there to handle all the broken bits of glass   was it mom who put my dad out on his ass or the other way around?   well, i'm far too old to care about that now    what about taking this empty cup and filling it up   with a little bit more of innocence, i haven't had enough   it's probably because when you're young   it's okay to be easily ignored   i'd like to believe it was all about love for a child    it's kinda nice to work the floor since the divorce   i've been enjoying both my christmases and my birthday cakes   and taking drugs and making love at far too young an age   and they never checked to see my grades   what a fool i'd be to start complaining now        what about taking this empty cup and filling it up   with a little bit more of innocence, i haven't had enough   it's probably because when you're young   it's okay to be easily ignored   i'd love to believe it was all about love for a child   it was all about love   '
