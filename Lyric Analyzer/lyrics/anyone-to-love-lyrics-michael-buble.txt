     another night, another drink   another time to contemplate and think   will i ever, ever have anyone to love    it's not that i don't try   maybe i try too hard   seems like i'm living a lie   so there's a game i just won't learn   and i wonder will i always be alone   i take a sip and wonder   why i haven't anyone to love             i guess i'll say goodnight   my drink's done and it's morning light   sorry my friend but you see   what other ending could there be   and i wonder will i always be alone?   i take a drink and wonder   will i ever have anyone to love?
