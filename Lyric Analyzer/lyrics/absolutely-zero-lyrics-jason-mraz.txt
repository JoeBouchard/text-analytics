     you. you were a friend.   you were a friend of mine i let you spend the night.   you see, it was my fault. of course it was mine.    i'm too hard at work.   have you ever heard of anything so absurd ever in your life?   i'm sorry for wasting your time.    who am i to say this situation isn't great?   when it's my job to make the most of it   of course i didn't know that it would happen to me.   not that easy.    hey. what's that you say?   you're not blaming me for anything.   well, that's great, but i don't break that easy.   does it fade away?        so, that's why i'm ... i'm apologizing now   for telling you i thought that we could make it   i just don't get enough to believe that we've both changed.    see who am i to say this situation isn't great?   it is my time to make the most of it   of course i didn't know that it would happen to me.   not that easy, no.   no, no no.    if all along the fault is up for grabs,   why can't she have it?   if it's for sale, what is your offer?   i will sell it for no less than what i bought it for.   pay no more than absolutely zero.    well, neither one of us deserves the blame,   because opportunities moved us away.   it's not an easy thing to learn to play   a game that's made for two--that's you and me.   the rules remain a mystery.   see how it's easy?        so, who am i to say this situation isn't great?   when it's our time to make the most of it,   how could we ever know that this would happen to me?   not that easy, no.   no ...    when all along the fault is up for grabs, and there you have it.   well, it's for sale--go make your offer.   will i sell it for no less than what i bought it for me?   pay no more than absolutely zero?    (love, love)   '
