     well, i woke up to the sound of silence   the cars were cutting like knives in a fist fight   and i found you with a bottle of wine   your head in the curtains and heart like the fourth of july    you swore and said we are not, we are not shining stars   this i know, i never said we are   though i've never been through hell like that   i've closed enough windows to know you can never look back    if you're lost and alone or you're sinking like a stone, carry on   may your past be the sound of your feet upon the ground, carry on    carry on, carry on    so i met up with some friends in the edge of the night   at a bar off seventy five   and we talked and talked about how our parents will die   all our neighbours and wives        but i like to think i can cheat it all   to make up for the times i've been cheated on   and it's nice to know when i was left for dead   i was found and now i don't roam these streets, i am not the ghost you want of me    if you're lost and alone or you're sinking like a stone, carry on   may your past be the sound of your feet upon the ground and, carry on    woah, my head is on fire, but my legs are fine, after all they are mine   lay your clothes down on the floor   close the door, hold the phone, show me how   no one's ever gonna stop us now    'cause we are, we are shining stars   we are invincible, we are who we are   on our darkest day, when we're miles away   so we'll come, we will find our way home    if you're lost and alone or you're sinking like a stone, carry on   may your past be the sound of your feet upon the ground and, carry on        no one's ever gonna stop us now   no one's ever, no one's ever gonna stop   no one's ever gonna stop us now   no one's ever, no one's ever gonna stop   no one's ever gonna stop, no one's ever gonna stop us now   '
