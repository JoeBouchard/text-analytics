     it's off, it's on,   the party's just begun.   take off and run,   let's celebrate the fun of being young.    i don't wanna grow up,   i don't wanna grow up.    but when the lights come on,   you lift me up and i feel strong.    i won't be right without you,   and i might break without you.   i'd rather be poor and happy than rich and alone.    i'll write hit songs about you,   no matter how, we'll get through.   i'll keep on singing for a living,   but i wanna be in love.   and i wanna be with you.        i wanna be with you.    lights off, lights on,   the music has begun.   more light, you run,   get the bad guys gun.    i love the songs that you play,   and i don't care what they say.   'cause i was born this way.    i hear you scream,   i hit the top of the stage and...   close my eyes, i know exactly who i am,   oh-oh.    and i won't be right without you,   and i might break without you.   i'd rather be poor and happy than rich and alone.        i'll write hit songs about you,   no matter how, we'll get through.   i'll keep on singing for a living,   but i wanna be in love.   and i wanna be with you.    i wanna be with you.    i won't be right without you,   and i might break without you.   i'd rather be poor and happy than rich and alone.    i'll write hit songs about you,   no matter how, we'll get through.   i'll keep on singing for a living,   but i wanna be in love.    i wanna be with you,   wanna be with you.   wanna be with you.   wanna be with you.    i wanna be...   no matter what breaks me...    i wanna be with you   '
