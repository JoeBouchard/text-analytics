     i saw a photograph of ten years back   it's you and i, we're standing in the rain   somewhere outside atlanta and i think my   twelve-seat van is right there out of frame   this was before i knew my way around los angeles   before i ever cared about nice neighborhoods   we were driving through the night   sleeping on hotel floors   and thinking that we had it good    we were kids back then, thinking we would live forever   we were kids back then   we were wild and free, taking on the world together   we were kids back then   that's how we're always gonna be        i used to know a friend on my timeline   who had lately been on my mind   we were close as blood   and if we sat down for a drink i think we'd forget   all the stupid reasons we lost touch (we lost touch)   it was just because    we were kids back then, thinking we would live forever   we were kids back then   you and me   we were wild and free, taking on the world together   we were kids back then   that's how we're always gonna be    all you got to do is blink your eyes and the years go by like that   they fly right past   i don't want to wait to realize everything that you and i   already have        five-thirty in the morning and we're awake again   you are holding baby jane   i lean in to take a picture when it hits me   in twenty years i will look back and say    we were kids back then, thinking we would live forever   we were kids back then   we're so young and free, taking on the world together   we were kids back then   that's how we're always gonna be    we were kids back then, thinking we would live forever   we were kids back then   you and me   we were wild and free, taking on the world together   we were kids back then   that's how we're always gonna be   that's how we're always gonna be   oh, that's how we're always gonna be   '
