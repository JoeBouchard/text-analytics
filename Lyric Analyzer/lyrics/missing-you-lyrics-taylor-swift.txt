     taylor (spoken):   let me tell you a little bit about tyler hilton   um, i met him a couple months ago   doing a show out in california   um and i had met him because he had said some nice things about me in a magazine and said "ya know i'm a really big fan of taylor swift's music" and i read that and i'm like wow thats really cool so i had my management contact his management and he arranged to come be at one of my shows.and so, ya know, i asked him to come out and sing with me.and while he was standing there next to me on stage i said "tyler, how would you like to be in one of my music videos?" and uh, the crowd, he was kinda silent but the crowd was like "yeah! oh my god!" you guys know how to do that?    crowd:   woo!!    taylor (spoken):   thats what i like to hear. anyways, so he's standing here on stage and i'm like straight up "do you wanna be in a music video? i'm shooting one in a couple weeks. and uh he goes "well, i guess. yeah sure." because i mean the crowd was going so loud that if he would have said no they would have probably booed him off the stage. which was kinda my point and asking him on stage. so basically i forced him to be in my music video.have yall seen that one? would yall like me to bring him out and do a song with him? tyler hilton's in the house tonight! so uh, the song i asked to sing with him um a couple months ago when we had a show together was one that he sings on one tree hill. ya see, tyler is on the show one tree hill because he's cool. he was also in the movie walk the line, he played elvis presley.so i decided to go all out for my hometown. so uh, tyler ya gonna sing a song with me?    tyler (spoken):   yeah   lets do it!   if ya guys know, sing along too.        taylor:   everytime i think of you   i always catch my breath   i'm still standing here   and your miles away   and i wonder why you left me   and there's a storm that's raging through my frozen heart tonight    tyler:   i hear your name in certain circles   and it always makes me smile   i spent my time just thinkin about you   and its almost driving me wild    but its my heart thats beggin down this long distance line tonight    both:   and i ain't missin' you at all   since you've been gone... away   i ain't missin' you   no matter what i might say        tyler:   there's a message in the wires   and i am sendin' you a signal tonight   you don't know how desperate i've become   and it looks like i'm loosein' this fight    but it's my heart that's breakin' down this long dusty road of mine    both:   but i ain't missin' you at all   since you've been gone... away   i aint missin' you at   no matter what my friends say    taylor:   and there's a message that i'm sendin' out   like a telograph to you or something   i can't bridge this distance   honey, stop this heart ache all alone    both:   i ain't missin' you at all   since you've been gone... away   i ain't missin' you   no matter what my friends say   i ain't missin' you   since you've been gone... away   i ain't missin you   yeah, no matter what your friends say    hey yeah, yeah yeah yeah    i ain't missin you at all   since you've been gone... away   i ain't missin' you   nooo    taylor (spoken):   good night everybody!   woo!   woo   ya like that girls?
