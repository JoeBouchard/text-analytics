     last night i heard my own heart beating   sounded like footsteps on my stairs   six months gone and i'm still reaching   even though i know you're not there   i was playing back a thousand memories, baby   thinking about everything we've been through   maybe i've been going back too much lately   when time stood still and i had you    come back, come back, come back to me like   you would, you would if this was a movie   standing in the rain outside until i came out   come back, come back, come back to me like   you could, you could if you just said you're sorry   i know that we could work it out somehow   but if this was a movie, you'd be here by now        i know people change and these things happen   but i remember how it was back then   wrapped up in your arms and friends were laughing   cause nothing like this ever happened to them   now i'm pacing down the hall   chasing down your street   flashback to night when you said to me   and nothing's gonna change, not for me and you    that before i knew how much i had to lose   come back, come back, come back to me like   you would, you would if this was a movie   standing in the rain outside until i came out   come back, come back, come back to me like   you could, you could if you just said you're sorry   i know that we could work it out somehow        but if this was a movie, you'd be here by now   if you're out there, if you're somewhere, if you're moving on   i've been waiting for you ever since you've been gone   i just want it back the way it was before   and i just want to see you back at my front door   and i'd say   come back, come back, come back to me like you would   before you said it's not that easy    before the fight, before i let you walk   but i take it all back now   come back, come back, come back to me like   you would, you would if this was a movie    standing in the rain outside until i came out   come back, come back, come back to me like   you could, you could if you just said you're sorry   i know that we could work it out somehow   but if this was a movie, you'd be here by now   you'd be here by now   it's not the kind of ending you wanna see now   baby, what about the ending   oh i thought you'd be here by now   that you'd be here by now   '
