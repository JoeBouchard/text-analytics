     there are some nights i hold to every note i ever wrote   some nights i say: "fuck it all!" stare at the calendar   waiting for catastrophes, imagining they'd scare me   into changing whatever it is i am changing into    and you have every right to be scared    'cause there are some nights i hold you close, pushing you to hold me   or begging you to lock me up, never let me see the world   some nights, i live in horror of people on the radio   tea parties and twitter, i've never been so bitter             and you, why you wanna stay?   oh my god! have you listened to me lately?   lately, i've been going crazy (so crazy)    and you, why you wanna stay?   oh my god! have you listened to me lately, lately?   lately, i've been fucking crazy             there are some nights i wait for someone to save us   but i never look inward, try not to look upward   and some nights i pray a sign is gonna come to me   but usually, i'm just trying to get some sleep    some nights!
