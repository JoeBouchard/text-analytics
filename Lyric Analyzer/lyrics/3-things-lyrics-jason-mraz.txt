     there are three things i do when my life falls apart   number one i cry my eyes out and i dry up my heart   not until i do this will my new life start   so that's the first thing that i do when my life falls apart.    oh the second thing i would do is i would close both of my eyes   and sing my thank yous to each and every moment of my life.   i go where i know the love is and let it feel me up inside   gathering new strength from sorrow,   i'm glad to be alive.             things are looking up.   i know above the clouds the sun is shining.   things are looking up.   love is still the answer i'm relying on.    three little things.   things are looking up.    yeah the third thing that i do now when my world caves in,   is i pause i take a breath and bow and i let that chapter end.   i design my future bright not by where my life has been.   and i try, try, try, try, try again.   yes i try, try, try, try, try again.             things are looking up.   i know beyond the dark the sun is rising.   things are looking up.   i know above the clouds the sun is shining.   things are looking up.   love is still the answer i'm relying on.    three little things.   three little things.
