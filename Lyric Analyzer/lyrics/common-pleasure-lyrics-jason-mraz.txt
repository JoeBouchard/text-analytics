     said will i,   i remember when we used to walk together,   used to talk together, go to the park together,   in all of kinds of weather we would share,   this common pleasure, with most of human kinds,   it was a kind of treasure, one i was surely glad to find,   and i got some right here, and i'm okay, i'm okay   you're okay, ha ha, we're okay, ha ha ooha i am alright,   i answered alright, i'm doin' fine, but ohh bones again are broken,   the love is not a token of affection, it's not even a real thing,   it's a word, so don't try to buy it out with a ring,   'cause it's a verb, to love someone, open up and let them in,   just don't, just don't be afraid, don't be afraid to set them again,   this ain't no heaven, ain't no hell, ain't no in-between,   'cause there's just too many faces and places in this world,   that i ain't never seen, i'm gonna keep on keeping on on,   i'm gonna reap on being strong, and i got my head on,        though misconnected, its alright 'cause i do it protected,   i got a day job, i drive a cheap ride, sounds like i'm gonna be fine,   you only get one life to learn, there's only so many brain cells you can burn,   an' life can take a turn, and take away everything that you've earned,   and leave you yearnin' for more more more,   life is gonna leave you yearnin' for more more more,   your stomach gonna be churnin' wantin' more,   you wantin' wantin' some more, you wantin' some more,   do you want some?   do you want some?   then i got some,   um (a bunch of times),   well i got one right here,   and i'm okay, i'm okay,   and you're okay, ha ha, we're okay, ha ha ooha i am alright.   i answered alright, i'm doin' fine.
