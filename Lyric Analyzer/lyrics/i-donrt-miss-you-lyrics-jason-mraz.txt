     every day is a day in paradise   i choose to view my life   is not a dream i can see   how the world is alive,   is everchanging    every season's a brand new style and dress   every day gets my sunday best   but many hours i lay awake,   wondering how the hell you are today    'cause as carefree as you came to me   you turn around and became a memory   you know how i know god loves me?   'cause i'm still standing    i don't miss you 'cause i'm always thinking about you in my arms   i don't miss you 'cause i'm always living with you in my heart        not every night does the moon rise red   low in the sky just above our heads   you only get a little minute to hold it,   let's just enjoy each moment    i enjoy the intensity of being your boy,   and you being there for me   for many moons i reminisce   and keep the light for ever led, yeah    as quickly as you came to me   you took a bow and became a memory   you know how i know god loves me?   'cause i'm still standing    i don't miss you 'cause i'm always thinking about you in my arms   i don't miss you 'cause i'm always living with you in my heart    i'm in a place of peace   and i'm holding you up to the highest   well i'm grateful for the ride, yes   i still love you        i don't miss you 'cause i'm always thinking about you in my arms   i don't miss you 'cause i'm always living with you down in my heart   i don't miss you 'cause i'm always thinking about you wherever you are   i don't miss you 'cause i'm always living with you deep down in my heart   i don't miss you 'cause i'm always, always, always thinking about you   i don't miss you 'cause i'm always, always, always living with you   down in my heart, in my heart   '
