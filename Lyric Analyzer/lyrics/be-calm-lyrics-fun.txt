     as i walk through the streets of my new city   my back feeling much better, i suppose   i've reclaimed the use of my imagination   for better or for worse, i've yet to know    but i always knew you'd be the one to understand me   i guess that's why it took so long to get things right   suddenly i'm lost on my street, on my block   oh why, oh why    oh why haven't you been there for me?   can't you see, i'm losing my mind this time?   this time i think it's for real, i can see    all the tree tops turning red   the beggars near bodegas grin at me   i think they want something   i close my eyes, i tell myself to breathe        and be calm   be calm   i know you feel like you are breaking down   well, i know that it gets so hard sometimes   be calm    i'm scared that everyone is out to get me   "these days before you speak to me you pause."
