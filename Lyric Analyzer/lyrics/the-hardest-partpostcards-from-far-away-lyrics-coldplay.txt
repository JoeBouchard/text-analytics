     the hardest part   was letting go not taking part   was the hardest part   and the strangest thing   was waiting for that bell to ring   it was the strangest start   i could feel it go down   bittersweet i could taste in my mouth   oh silver lining the clouds   oh but i   i wonder what it's all about        the hardest part   was letting go not taking part   you really broke my heart, oh   and i tried to sing   but i couldn't think of anything   that was the strangest start, oh, oh   i could feel it go down   you left the sweetest taste in my mouth    oh silver lining the cloud    oh but i   oh yes i   i wonder what it's all about   'cause everything i know is wrong   and everything i do it just comes undone   and everything is torn apart   oh, and that's the hardest part        that's the hardest part   that's the hardest part   that's the hardest part.
