     take your time coming home.   hear the wheels as they roll.   let your lungs fill up with smoke.   forgive everyone.    she is here and now she is gone.   we had plans, we can't help but make love.    it's a beautiful thing when you love somebody,   and i love somebody.   yeah i love somebody.    take your time coming home.   hear the wheels as they roll.   let your lungs fill with smoke.   forgive everyone.   i don't think i'd been misled,   it was a rock 'n' roll band,   i'm still standing,   take your time coming home.        see, of everyone who called,   very few said, "we believe in you."   the overwhelming choice said   i'm just a boy inside a voice.   and if it's true, if it's true, if that's true,   then what the f**k have i been doing the last six years?   how did i end up here?   how did i find love and conquer all my fears?   see, i made it out.   out from under the sun.   and the truth is that i feel better because i've forgiven everyone.    now i'm not scared   of a song   or the states,   or the stages.   i'm not scared.   i got friends,   took my call,   came courageous.   now i feel like i am home.        one more thing, i keep having this dream   where i'm standing on a mountain   looking down on the street   i can hear kids in low-income houses singing   "we're through with causing a scene"   i don't know what it means   but i too, i'm through with causing a scene.    she is here and now i think she's ready to go.   for every love that's lost i heard a new one comes.    so come on with me, sing along with me,   let the wind catch your feet.   if you love somebody,   you'd better let them know.    take your time coming home.
