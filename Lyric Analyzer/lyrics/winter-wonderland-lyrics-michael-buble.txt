     sleigh bells ring, are you listening,   in the lane, snow is glistening   a beautiful sight,   we're happy tonight.   walking in a winter wonderland.    gone away is the bluebird,   here to stay is a new bird   he sings a love song,   as we stroll along,   walking in a winter wonderland.             in the meadow we can build a snowman,   will pretend that he is parson brown   he'll say: are you ready?   we'll say: no man,   but you can do the job   when you're in town.    later on, we'll conspire,   as we dream by the fire   to face unafraid,   the plans that we've made,   walking in a winter wonderland.    in the meadow we can build a snowman,   will pretend that he is parson brown   he'll say: are you ready?   we'll say: no man,   but you can do the job   when you're in town.        later on, we'll conspire,   as we dream by the fire   to face unafraid,   the plans that we've made,   walking in a winter wonderland.   walking in a winter wonderland.   walking in a winter wonderland.
