     it's getting late, and i   cannot seem to find my way home tonight.   feels like i am falling down a rabbit hole.   falling for forever, wonderfully wandering alone.   what would my head be like   if not for my shoulders?   or without your smile?   may it follow you forever   may it never leave you   to sleep in the storm,   may we stay lost on our way home    c'mon, c'mon, with everything falling down around me   i'd like to believe in all the possibilities        if i should die tonight   may i first just say i'm sorry   for i, never felt like anybody   i am a man of many hats although i   never mastered anything   when i am ten feet tall   i never felt this smaller since the fall   nobody seems to know my name   so don't leave me to sleep all alone   may we stay lost on our way home    c'mon, c'mon, with everything falling down around me   i'd like to believe in all the possibilities   c'mon, c'mon, with everything falling down around me   i'd like to believe in all the possibilities    try not to mistake what you have with what you hate    it could leave, it could leave, come the morning        celebrate the night   it's the fall before the climb    shall we sing, shall we sing, til the morning    if i fall forward, you fall flat    and if the sun should lift me up   would you come back?   c'mon    c'mon, c'mon, with everything falling down around me   i'd like to believe in all the possibilities    c'mon, c'mon, with everything falling down around me   i'd like to believe in all the possibilities    so c'mon, c'mon, with everything falling down around me   i'd like to believe in all the possibilities   yeah yeah yeah!    it's getting late and i, cannot seem to find my way home tonight.
