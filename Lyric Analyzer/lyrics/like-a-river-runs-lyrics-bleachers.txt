     i woke up thinking you were still here   my hands shaking with regret   i've held this dream for such a long long time   and i wanna get up   to the rhythm of a wild, to the rhythm of a wild heart   that beats, that beats like a rolling drum    i saw you standing on the corner   i saw you standing on your own   and i get the feeling that it's, it's all a dream   and i wanna get up   to the rhythm of a wild, to the rhythm of a wild heart   that beats, that beats like a drum    when i fall asleep i can see your face   what i lost in you i will not replace   and i could run away, i could let them down   but i will remember your light        your light it follows me in darkness   i'm trying hard but i can't win   and i've played the victim for a long long time   and i wanna grow up   from the rhythm a young, from the rhythm of a younger heart   it leads just like a river runs    that night i sent over the parkway   the summer's gone and i'm alone   and i get the feeling that you're somewhere close   and i wanna get up   to the rhythm of your wild, to the rhythm of your wild heart   it beats, been beating since you've gone    when i fall asleep i can see your face   what i lost in you i will not replace   and i could run away, i could let them down   but i will remember        when i fall asleep i can see your face   what i lost in you i will not replace   and i could run away, i could let them down   and i know you're gone but still i will remember your light    i will remember   i will remember   i will remember   i will remember    and if you see me in the darkness   i hope you know i'm not alone   i carry you with every breath i take   i won't let up, i won't let up   until the wind is gone   '
