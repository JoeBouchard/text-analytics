     i fell in love with a wind-up souvenir   i bought it downtown as i was on my way to meet you   she sounds like the songs   you used to sing to put me to sleep   but, now that you're gone   she's all that i've left to hold   and i feel so all alone   no one's gonna fix me when i'm broke   how do you cry with inanimate eyes   you're never gonna smile   with the way that you're wired   and i feel so all alone   i gave her to you (i don't need a toy)   i thought you might appreciate it (i don't like the way that it moves)   the way that she dances   the painted look upon her face (someone must've thrown this away)   she must've come from the sun   i want take her through the park   where she'd tell me i'm all (speak english) that she wants   if she could even talk   and i feel so all alone   no one's gonna fix me when i'm broke   how do you cry with inanimate eyes   you're never gonna smile   with the way that you're wired   and i feel so all alone   i feel so all alone   and she sings you're my shell   it makes me think of you   the way she carries the things   that remind me of who   we used to be, before   we became antiques   she's a lot like you   but when i hold her too   tight, i know she'll break   she just takes some glue to stay   and i feel so all alone   no one's gonna fix me when i'm broke   how do you cry with inanimate eyes   you're never gonna smile   with the way that you're wired   and i feel so all alone   i feel so all alone   i feel so all alone              '
