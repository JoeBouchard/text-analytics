     i once found a ring,   lying on the ground,   smeagol came looking for it,   and he saw i had it,    oouuchhh...   oouuchhh...    the smeagol just shanked me,   he wanted his ring,   his face was hideous,   but i thought it had,             some kind of beauutyy,   some kind of beauutyy,    shoooshh,   he's back again,   he grabbed the wrong fish,   and wants revenge,    oouuchhh...   oouuchhh...             i was shot this time,   it was done with a glock nine,   i couldn't help but think again,   of the ugly face that had,    some kind of beauutyy,   some kind of beauutyy,   some kind of beauutyyyy.
