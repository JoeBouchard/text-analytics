     well i'm not just a song anymore   i just might be the whole damn score   i might be reeling in your head while   you're sleeping in your bed at night   well i'm not just along anymore   i finally found what i've been lookin' for   i might be sitting in the passenger's   side but not along for the ride   'cause i have control of a home grown situation   i lay back and then i turn the alarm off and turn out the light   there's goin' to be some quality sleeping   'cause quality's keeping the quality up at night   i am fixed to lay with my arms out and learning to fly        through the darkest space   where i try to catch up to the catch phrase   to human race i say let the games begin   under way say in conditions that we play in   maybe things are better this way   may the games begin today awww    oh well... cause i'm just above   the aggravation of love   and i raise to optimistical fortune and toasting it twice   i'm sitting high on an anytime any day night   and i laugh to think i'm crying my eyes out well isn't it nice    (chorus)             an open space when i finally catch up to the catch phrase   the whole damn world is your toy   don't you want some love   don't you want things to always stay the same   don't you want your love to be the same as the last day   '
