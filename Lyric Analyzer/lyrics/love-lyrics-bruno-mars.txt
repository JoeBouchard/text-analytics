     now hollywood wants to make you think they know what love is. but i'm a tell you what true love is. love is not what you see in the movies. it's not the ecstasy it's not what you see in that scene you know what i mean? i'm telling you right now true love is sacrifice. love is thinking about others before you think about yourself love is selfless not selfish. love is god and god is love. love is when you lay down your life for another whether for your brother your mother your father or your sister it's even laying down your life for your enemies that's unthinkable but think about that. love is true. think.    i'll put you in front of me   so everybody can see   my love this is my love    i know that i'll be alright   as long as you are my guide   my love this is my love    love is patient love is kind. it does not envy it does not boast it is not proud. it is not rude it is not self-seeking it is not easily angered it keeps no record of wrongs. love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. it always protects always trusts always hopes it always perseveres.   love never fails. love is everlasting it's eternal it goes on and on it goes beyond time love is the only thing that will last when you die but ask the question why? do you have love?             i'll put you in front of me   so everybody can see   my love this is my love    i know that i'll be alright   as long as you are my guide   my love this is my love    there is no greater love than this than he who lays down his life for his friends. now are you willing to lay down your life for your friends? you're probably willing to lay down your life for your mother your father or your best friends but are you willing to lay down your life for even those that hate you? i'm going to tell you who did that the definition of love is jesus christ. he is love. the nails in his hands the thorns in his brow hanging on a cross for your sin my sins that is love he died for you and me while we still hated him that is love. god is true love and if you don't know this love now is the time to know perfect love.             i'll put you in front of me   so everybody can see   my love this is my love    i know that i'll be alright   as long as you are my guide   my love this is my love   '
