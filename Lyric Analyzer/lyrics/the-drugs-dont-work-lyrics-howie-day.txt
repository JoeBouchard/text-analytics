     all this talk of getting old   it's getting me down my love,   like a cat in a bag waiting to drown   this time i'm coming down.    and i hope you're thinking of me   as you lay down on your side.    now the drugs don't work, they just make you worse   but i know i'll see your face again.    and i know i'm on a losing streak   as i pass down by your street.   and if you want a show   then just let me know   and i'll sing in your ear again.    now the drugs don't work, they just make you worse   but i know i'll see your face again.        cause maybe   if heaven calls   i'm coming to   just like you said.   if you leave my life   i'm better off dead.    all this talk of getting old   it's getting me down my love,   like a cat in a bag waiting to drown   this time i'm coming down.    cause maybe   if heaven calls   i'm coming to   just like you said.   if you leave my life   i'm better off dead.        now the drugs don't work, they just make you worse   but i know i'll see your face again.    now the drugs don't work, they just make you worse   but i know i'll see your face again.    now the drugs don't work, they just make you worse   but i know i'll see your face again.
