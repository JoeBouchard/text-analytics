     put your lips close to mine   as long as they don't touch.   out of focus, out of eye   till the gravity is too much.    and i'll do anything you say   if you say it with your hands.   and i'd be smart to walk away   but you're quicksand.    this slope is treacherous   this path is reckless   this slope is treacherous   and i, i, i like it.    i can't decide if it's a choice   getting swept away.   i hear the sound of my own voice   asking you to stay.        and all we are is skin and bone   trained to get along.   forever going with the flow   but you're friction.    this slope is treacherous   this path is reckless   this slope is treacherous   i, i, i like it.    two headlights shine   through the sleepless night   and i will get you   will get you alone.    your name has echoed   through my mind   and i just think you, should think   you should know.        that nothing safe is   worth the drive and i will   follow you, follow you home   i'll follow you, follow you home.    this hope is treacherous   this daydream is dangerous   this hope is treacherous   i i i, i i i, i i i.    two headlights shine   through the sleepless night   and i will get you   will get you alone.    your name has echoed   through my mind   and i just think you should   think you should know.   that not being safe is   worth the driving and i will   follow you, follow you home   i'll follow you, follow you home.   i'll follow you, follow you home   i'll follow you, follow you home   i'll follow you, follow you home   this slope is treacherous   i, i, i like it.
