     i can only give you love that lasts forever,   and a promise to be near each time you call.   and the only heart i own   for you and you alone   that's all,   that's all...    i can only give you country walks in springtime   and a hand to hold when leaves begin to fall;   and a love whose burning light   will warm the winter's night   that's all,   that's all.        there are those i am sure who have told you,   they would give you the world for a toy.   all i have are these arms to enfold you,   and a love time can never destroy.    if you're wondering what i'm asking in return, dear,   you'll be glad to know that my demands are small.   say it's me that you'll adore,   for now and evermore   that's all,   that's all.             if you're wondering what i'm asking in return, dear,   you'll be glad to know that my demands are small.   say it's me that you'll adore,   for now and evermore   that's all,   that's all.
