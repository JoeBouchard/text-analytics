     some day, when i'm awfully low   when the world is cold   i will feel a glow just thinking of you   and the way you look tonight    you're lovely, with your smile so warm   and your cheeks so soft   there is nothing for me but to love you   and the way you look tonight    with each word your tenderness grows   tearing my fears apart   and that laugh that wrinkles your nose   touches my foolish heart        yes you're lovely, never, ever change   keep that breathless charm   won't you please arrange it?   'cause i love you   just the way you look tonight    with each word your tenderness grows   tearing my fears apart   and that laugh that wrinkles your nose   touches my foolish heart             yes you're lovely, never, ever change   keep that breathless charm   won't you please arrange it?   'cause i love you   just the way you look tonight   just the way you look tonight   darling   just the way you look tonight   '
