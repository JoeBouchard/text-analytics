     when she was just a girl,   she expected the world,   but it flew away from her reach,   so she ran away in her sleep.    dreamed of para-para-paradise,   para-para-paradise,   para-para-paradise,   every time she closed her eyes.    oh-oh oh-oooh oh-oh-oh             when she was just a girl,   she expected the world,   but it flew away from her reach,   and bullets catch in her teeth.   life goes on,   it gets so heavy,   the wheel breaks the butterfly.   every tear, a waterfall.   in the night, the stormy night,   she closed her eyes.   in the night,   the stormy night,   away she flied.    i dream of para-para-paradise,   para-para-paradise,   para-para-paradise,   whoa-oh-oh oh-oooh oh-oh-oh        she dreamed of para-para-paradise,   para-para-paradise,   para-para-paradise,   whoa-oh-oh oh-oooh oh-oh-oh    la-la-la-la-la   la-la-la-la-la   la-la-la-la    still lying underneath the stormy skies.   she said oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh.   i know the sun's set to rise.    this could be   oh-oh oh-oooh oh-oh-oh.   paradise   oh-oh oh-oooh oh-oh-oh.   paradise   oh-oh oh-oooh oh-oh-oh.   paradise   whoa-oh-oh oh-oooh oh-oh-oh    this could be   oh-oh oh-oooh oh-oh-oh.   paradise   oh-oh oh-oooh oh-oh-oh.   paradise   oh-oh oh-oooh oh-oh-oh.   paradise   whoa-oh-oh oh-oooh oh-oh-oh    this could be   oh-oh oh-oooh oh-oh-oh.   paradise   oh-oh oh-oooh oh-oh-oh.   paradise   oh-oh oh-oooh oh-oh-oh.   paradise   whoa-oh-oh oh-oooh oh-oh-oh    oh-oh oh-oooh oh-oh-oh   oh-oh oh-oooh oh-oh-oh   oh-oh oh-oooh oh-oh-oh...
