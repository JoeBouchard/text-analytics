     how do i end up in the same old place   faced again with the same mistakes   so stubborn thinking i know what is right   but life proves me wrong everytime   taking roads that lead me nowhere   how do i expect to get there   but when, oh when will i learn to just put you first.    i come to you now when i need you   but why do i wait to come see you   i always try to do this on my own   but i was wrong cause only with you can i move on.   can i move on.        when i am weak it's you that makes me strong   and i know that you've been with me all along   so many times i begin to close my eyes and listen to my heart   with you life is so easy why do i make it hard   oh taking roads that lead me nowhere how do i expect to get there when will i   learn to just put you first.    hey!   i come to you now when i need you   but why do i wait to come see you   i always try to do this on my own   but i was wrong cause only with you can i move on.    i get out of my own way, let you have your way.   cause i realize i'm no good on my own   i'm there for you, i'll serve for you   i can't live without you. noooo        i come to you now when i need you   why do i wait to come see you   i always try to do this on my own   but i was wrong, i was wrong, i was wrong.   with only you, only you, with only you.   can i move on, can i move on, can i move on...
