     i heard a song tonight on the radio   another girl sings about a boy   she sees his face in every space in every room   and i know that if i turn around you won't be there   if i close my eyes will you be there?    i don't wanna lose your face   i don't wanna wake up one day   and not remember what time erased   i don't wanna turn around   cause i'm not scared   of what love gave me and took away        and i don't wanna lose your face   i've got a picture of you in my bedroom   i hope it never falls   i hope i never lose that feeling   i used to get when you would call   and now i wonder to myself    who were you and where are you?   were you ever here at all?   i don't wanna lose your face   i don't wanna wake up one day   and not remember what time erased   i don't wanna turn around    cause i'm not scared   of what love gave me and took away   and i don't wanna lose your face   that girl in the song had it so good   i wish i could close my eyes and see you   i wish the sky had your face        and the oceans had your eyes   and the sunset had your lips   and i had you   i don't wanna lose your face   i don't wanna wake up one day   and not remember what time erased   and i don't wanna turn around   cause i'm not scared   of what love gave me and took away   and i don't wanna lose your face   oh no no   i don't wanna lose your face   i don't wanna turn around   i don't wanna lose your face   '
