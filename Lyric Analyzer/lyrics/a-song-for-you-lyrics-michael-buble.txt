'cause we're alone now and i'm singing this song for you    you taught me precious secrets of the truth withholding nothing   you came out in front and i was hiding   but now i'm so much better, so if my words don't come together   listen to the melody 'cause my love is in there hiding    i love you in a place where there's no space or time   i love you for my life as you are a friend of mine   and when my life is over, remember, when we were together   we were alone and i was singing that song for you        and when my life is over, remember, when we were together   we were alone and i was singing my song for you, oh, for you           '
