     running to catch up again, jumping higher and flying more often than not   your trampoline has got holes in it but i can still see the top   let me climb aboard and sample some of next year's fashion   i'll wear the coat if you can put the hat on, i will wear the coat,   just let me clear my throat so i can say what's been delayed aways    let me fall into your lap and just lay here for awhile   satisfied by your seduction like a handshake would do the job   never know how long i have waited, anticipated your smile to be pressed against mine   your smile pressed against mine, your smile pressed against mine   i feel it, well i feel it (oh boy)   well i feel it and i'm gonna settle tight        she could pour me over this sugar hill or mountain   until i get that cool breeze, tight squeeze, i'd do it over again   and i drink from her ever flowing fountain   and then i wake up i comb my hair and i hurry it up   but i arrive late i pack my things and i pick it up   well i put down a good amount of deodorant this morning   and i found that i could drown a little bit of peace of mind   cause it's no secret that to some degree they're gonna have to see you sweat   strong enough for a man just do what you can to keep me soft and dry, i stink awhile    i don't know anything about those things   i almost don't wanna know anything about those things   and i don't care anything about those things   cause if i did you know i'd share myself on those things, and i feel it        and i'll be here all night, i'll pick up the pieces and i put them back together now   they may not be the right way but that's okay as long as they're all the same   i wish you well that you'd get better, and i know you'll find that it's a wild world   and if you had noticed well would you have thrown the towel in   before i missed out on all this love, and watch me roll away again   watch me disappear under my skin   i don't believe it that things could get any worse than they did that time   you must have seen it i mean how could we get lost running in a straight line   your cries of why's and why not's, may it all get back to you   and trickle and dance upon your headaches, years of biting cheeks are through   so i don't believe in it.    but i feel it.
