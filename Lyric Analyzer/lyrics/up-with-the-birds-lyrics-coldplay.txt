     the birds they sang, at break of day   "start again", i hear them say   it's so hard to just walk away    the birds they sang, all a choir   "start again a little higher"   it's a spark in a sea of grey    the sky is blue   dreamed out loud 'til it's true   then takin' back the punch i threw   my arms turn wings   oh, those clumsy things   send me up to that wonderful world   and then i'm up with the birds        might have to go   where they don't know my name   float all over the world   just to see her again   and i won't show or fear any pain   even though all my armour   might rust in the rain             a simple plot but i know one day   good things are coming our way   a simple plot but i know one day   good things are coming our way    oh, yeah...!!!
