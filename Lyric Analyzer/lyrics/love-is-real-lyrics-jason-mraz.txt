     love is real it is not just in novels or the movies   it is fact and it is standing here right in front of you   so if you just open your eyes, oh what a sweet discovery   there is hope, and there is joy and there is acceptance    so now let all the light that collects on your plants keep you warm, make you   smile   and i will be there with this pen in my hand to record all the while   you'll be laughing so loud that the house will shake with sound   and everything will be as new as the day it was found             oh, love is real it is not just in long-distance commercials   or something that you thought you felt back in high school   so i will turn black and white become that horoscope you're reading   it predicts that something good is on its way    and i'll send you all the world green and blue in a box through the mail   you can open it up, hold it right in your hand and be glad that it's there   and be glad that you're there    now you can feel all the knots in your stomach they start to untie   and suddenly it's not so hard to say you're alright             oh, love is real it is not just in poetry and stories   it is truth and it will follow you everywhere you go from now on   so if you just cast all off your doubts then your lips would answer for you   oh, my darling when you smile it is like a song   i can hear it now   and i can hear it now...
