     life is so simple   a little boy, a little girl   laughing and loving   trying to figure out the world   it felt like summer   when i kissed you in the rain   and i know your story   but tell me again    nothing you say wouldn't interest me   all of your words are like poems to me   i would be honored if you would take me as i am        i want you to look right in my eyes   to tell me you love me, to be by my side   i want you at the end of my life   i wanna see your face, when i fall with grace   at the moment i die   is that alright?   is that alright?    i hope you're still with me when i'm not quite myself   and i pray that you'll lift me when you know i need help   it's a warm celebration of all of our years   i dream of our story, of our fairy tale    family dinners and family trees   teaching the kids to say thank you and please   knowing if we stay together that things will be right        i want you to look right in my eyes   to tell me you love me, to be by my side   i want you at the end of my life   i wanna see your face, when i fall with grace   at the moment i die   is that alright?   is that alright?   is that alright?
