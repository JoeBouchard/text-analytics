     so i call your name, cross my fingers   uncross the others, hesitate.   oh, i don't think straight with nothing to prove.    i don't wanna say i'm leaving   i will stay until the weekend.   and you can take all the things   the boxes and rings    and get going.   'cause i've been waiting for...   all the pretty girls on a saturday night.   let it be, and come to me with the look in your eyes.   will you break and take all the words from my mouth?    i wish all the pretty girls were shaking me down.   so i call you out   just to feel a little better about myself   i do, baby i do.        until their lips start to move   and their friends talk music   i say "i've never heard the tune!"   but i have, i just hate the band    'cause they remind me of you.   every single night ends up the same   i don't say much at all, but i bring up your name.    (over and over and over)   i think it's striking me out.   all the pretty girls on a saturday night   let it be, they come with me with the look in your eyes.    will you break and take all the words from my mouth?   i wish all the pretty girls were shaking me down.   but not you   you still wear boots and your hair is too long        and then this one doesn't want to admit she's fallen in love   oh c'mon, oh c'mon, what's a boy to do   when all the pretty girls can't measure to you?   i don't understand your reasons   please just stay over the weekend    you can't take all those things   they define you and me   everything we've become   you're all that i need    please don't make me face my generation alone.   all the pretty girls on a saturday night.   let it be, and come with me with the look in your eyes.   will you break and take all the words from my mouth?   i wish all the pretty girls were shaking me down.   but not you   i feel your faith is destroying the world   and then this one never really understood   the 80s is over and done   oh c'mon, what's a boy to do   when all the pretty girls can't measure to you?
