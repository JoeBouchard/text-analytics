This folder contains code for lyrical analysis. It is designed to seek out specified keywords in songs. It retrieves the lyrics of the songs from metrolyrics.com and saves them in plain-text form with no HTML formatting in the lyrics folder. Some songs are already in that folder, and it will grow as the code is used more. Songs stored on this machine are able to be accessed much more quickly, up to ten times faster. The lyrics saved here are also accessible by the sister project bundled with this one, predictive text.py. Results are saved in the Data By Key folder under numSongsWithKEYbyARTISTS.txt and timesInSongKEYSbyArtists. numSongs contains the number of songs each key, including no key, appeared in, while timesInSong contains the total number of times that key was in the songs. numSongs counts each song once, timesInSong counts the total number of occurances of each key in the songs.
