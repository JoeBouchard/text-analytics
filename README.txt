This folder contains two projects, Lyric Analyzer and Predictive Text. More on both of them can be found in their respective Readme files. They were only stored locally on my machine and not on git, and Predictive Text has some auxiliary features that utilize Lyric Analyzer, so I decided to bundle them together here rather than uploading them seperately.

The code in these projects can be found at https://github.com/JoeBouchard/text-analytics

This repo also contains an academic paper I wrote on Nasal Assimilation. I enjoy studying language in a variety of methods, and this repo represents that.
